~Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals
~Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal
~Voter cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT
~If majority of the voters vote for the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatically executed


## Tech Stack
~In this project I used Hardhat for an Ethereum development environment and framework. I go on to use React a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.

~The smart contract itself was written in Solidity language utilizing ethers.js which is a library that aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem

~Web3Modal library. Web3Modal is an easy to use library to help developers easily allow their users to connect to your dApps with all sorts of different wallets. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc) and WalletConnect

### Overview/Notes
The project came together flawlessly as a Decentralized Autonomous Organziation that provides NFT holder the abililty to craft & vote on proposals regarding the investment of funds into another contract which represents an NFT marketplace. Of course I added my personal touch when it came to bulding the frontend HTML & CSS a modification on the LW3 Design.  

#### Future Projects. 
A little bit of humour goes a long way these days but all jokes aside I'm working very hard to learn these things so I can start my own DAO that will be a part of Enigmatic AI ~ My passion project aimed at guiding motivated hard working people that are at high risk of losing their lifetime occupations due to automation at a rate we've never seen before & helping them transition into the future of labor which is theorized to be gig-like, creator oriented & digital.
